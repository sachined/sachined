> "Building Reasoning Engines that move beyond simple scripts."

I am an **AI Developer** and former **Solutions Engineer** focused on architecting production-grade ML systems and autonomous agent frameworks. I specialize in building **Python-driven agents** that plan and execute complex tasks with strict validation layers to eliminate "hallucination" and ensure data integrity.

#### 🏗️ Featured Project: [FinSurf 🏄‍♂️](https://github.com/sachined/FinSurf)
*An orchestration layer for autonomous financial intelligence.*

FinSurf is a decentralized network of specialized AI agents designed to navigate the complexities of financial data. It functions as a high-integrity research team, gathering and validating market data in real-time.

*   **The Goal**: Transform raw financial data into professional-grade reports using a multi-agent network.
*   **Technical Edge**: Implemented strict Python validation layers and automated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ensure high-fidelity outputs.
*   **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, LangChain, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Express.

#### 🧪 What I’m Building & Learning
*   🔭 **Current Project**: **FinSurf** - Expanding the *Profit Navigator* for historical price retrieval and projected exit strategies.
*   🌱 **Learning Path**: Deep-diving into ML/LLM fundamentals, Cloud Infrastructure (AWS/Docker), and Higher Mathematics.
*   🤔 **Seeking Input**: Exploring advanced architectures for handling massive project data dumps and optimizing multi-agent communication.

### 🧠 Summary of Learning: The FinSurf Journey

Building FinSurf was an exercise in bridging cutting-edge AI orchestration with professional-grade document engineering. Here is a summary of the core engineering achievements and lessons learned:

#### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration & Validation
The project demonstrated that complex tasks (like stock analysis) are best handled by a **collaborative network of specialists**.
*   **Isolation of Concerns**: By separating Research, Tax, Dividend, and Sentiment logic, we reduced "prompt drift" and improved output accuracy.
*   **Strict Validation**: Implementing mathematical precision for the Dividend Agent taught the importance of "Python-first" validation layers—calculating fractional shares and cumulative totals programmatically rather than relying on LLM arithmetic.

#### 2. Advanced Document Engineering (Tailwind 4 to PDF)
A significant technical challenge was generating PDFs from a modern **Tailwind CSS 4** environment.
*   **Color Conversion**: Since libraries like `html2canvas` do not natively support `oklch` or CSS variables, I developed a custom color-conversion utility to ensure high-fidelity rendering.
*   **Adaptive Pagination**: Developed logic to dynamically switch between "Single Page if Fits" and "Multi-page" layouts, optimizing the reading experience for digital reports.

#### 3. Responsive Layout Management
*   **Dynamic Grid Compression**: Implemented a "Unified Report Look" where the UI automatically shifts from a standard loading grid to a dense, gapless "Analysis Block" upon completion. This required tight synchronization between React state management and Tailwind's utility-first classes.
*   **Dual-Density Reporting**: Learning that different users prefer different data densities led to the **Standard vs HD View** toggle, providing flexibility between a balanced document and a high-density summary.

#### 4. Full-Stack RAG Implementation
*   **Real-Time Data Flow**: Integrating Perplexity for live web-search and Gemini/OpenAI for reasoning provided a robust template for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications that move beyond static data.

#### 5. Accessibility-First Architecture
*   Building the **Accessibility Mode** (High-Contrast/Neobrutalist) emphasized that financial tools must be legible and functional for all users, teaching that design accessibility is an architectural requirement, not an afterthought.
