> "Building Reasoning Engines that move beyond simple scripts."

I am an **AI Developer** and former **Solutions Engineer** focused on building production-grade ML systems and autonomous agent frameworks. I specialize in using **Python** to create agents that plan and execute tasks with strict validation layers to eliminate "hallucination" and data noise.

### 🏗️ Featured Project: FinSurf (AI Agent Network)
**FinSurf** is my most recent exploration into the power of Agent Networks. Building on the logic of my previous work, it functions as a pseudo-store and orchestration layer for autonomous financial data.

https://github.com/sachined/FinSurf
* **The Goal**: Creating a decentralized network of agents to handle data-heavy financial logic.
* **Technical Achievement**: Implemented strict Python validation layers to ensure agents only act on verified data.
* **Current Tech**: Python, Pandas, LangChain, and LangGraph.

### 🧪 What I’m Building & Learning
* 🔭 **Current Project**: Refining **WikiSurf-AI Agent**, an intelligent Wikipedia explorer (RAG implementation coming soon).
* 🌱 **Learning Path**: Deep-diving into ML/LLM fundamentals, Docker/AWS, Higher Math, and Cloud Infrastructure.
* 🤔 **Seeking Input**: I'm currently looking for better ways to handle massive project data dumps and patch holes in my coding architecture.

### 🤝 Let's Collaborate
I am looking to partner with other builders on the **automation of repetitive and mentally challenging tasks**.

* **Ask Me Anything**: I'm happy to be your "Bag" Head—I’ll smile, nod, and learn from your expertise while sipping a slurpie.
* **Reach Out**: [sachin.nediyanchath@gmail.com](mailto:sachin.nediyanchath@gmail.com)
* **Fun Fact**: I like pandas (the library and the animal) and racing down dirt roads at a blistering 1 m/s. 🤠
