Fin & WikiSurf: Autonomous Agent Frameworks

The Vision: Moving beyond simple scripts to create "Reasoning Engines." By using Python to build agents that can plan and execute tasks, I am exploring the same type of data-heavy logic that drives real-time game overlays.

Technical Achievement: Solved the challenge of "hallucination" and data noise by implementing strict validation layers in Python, ensuring the agent only acts on verified financial or research data.

## 🔥 Featured Projects
- **WikiSurf-AI Agent** — Intelligent Wikipedia exploration agent (RAG part coming soon once studied and understood)

## Planned Projects 
- 2 projects: 1 RAG, 1 Agent Network (pseudo store)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python | Pandas | LangChain | LangGraph

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on becoming an AI developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ML/LLM fundamentals, AI agent framework, Docker/AWS, Higher Math, and Cloud infrastructure.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on automation of repetitive and mentally challenging tasks.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with patching holes in my coding knowledge and how to handle all the data dumps these projects handle.
- 💬 Ask me about anything. I will learn from knowing what you know. I can be your "Bag" Head (smile and nod, while sipping on a slurpie).
